# SAIS: Symbiotic Artificial Immune Systems

## Note on Source Code Availability
The complete source code will be made available after the [camera ready date](https://gecco-2024.sigevo.org/Call-for-Papers#Important_Dates) of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO ’2024), July 14–18, 2024, Melbourne, Australia. This is to comply with the conference's submission and publication process. We appreciate your understanding and patience.

## Introduction
SAIS (Symbiotic Artificial Immune Systems) is a novel Artificial Immune System inspired by symbiotic relationships observed in biology. It leverages the three key stages of symbiotic relationships—mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism—for population updating, as seen in the Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS) algorithm. This approach effectively tackles the challenges associated with large population sizes and enhances population diversity, issues that traditional AIS and SOS algorithms struggle to address efficiently. This project aims to provide an open-source implementation of the SAIS algorithm to foster innovation and research in bio-inspired computing and immune-inspired algorithms.

## Features
- Innovative population update mechanism inspired by biological symbiosis.
- Comparable performance to the state-of-the-art SOS algorithm and superior to other popular AIS methods and evolutionary algorithms across 26 benchmark problems.
- Efficient handling of larger population sizes with fewer generations required.
