# SAIS: Symbiotic Artificial Immune Systems

![Symbiotic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rqcker/ImageHosting/master/dissertation/symbio3.png)

### Introduction
SAIS (Symbiotic Artificial Immune Systems) is a novel Artificial Immune System inspired by symbiotic relationships observed in biology. It leverages the three key stages of symbiotic relationships—mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism—for population updating, as seen in the Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS) algorithm. This approach effectively tackles the challenges associated with large population sizes and enhances population diversity, issues that traditional AIS and SOS algorithms struggle to address efficiently. This project aims to provide an open-source implementation of the SAIS algorithm to foster innovation and research in bio-inspired computing and immune-inspired algorithms.

### Features

- Implementation of the Symbiotic Artificial Immune Systems algorithm.
- Easy to calculate the objective value of the function.
- Customizable for different optimisation needs.
- Support for multiple benchmark functions.

### Quick Start

Ensure the following dependencies are installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- numpy

Install `sais` using pip:

```bash
pip install sais
```

Here's a simple example of how to use the SAIS package to optimise a function:

```python
from sais import run

# define your benchmark number and population size
population_size = 2000
# number from Benchmarks List
benchmark_number = 1

run(population_size, benchmark_number)
```

Example outputs:
```bash
Starting SAIS for benchmark 1 with population size 2000.
Iterations Number: 8
Running Time: 0.18377017974853516 Secounds
Best Fitness: 4.523554492464579e-10
Best Antibody: [2.9999822  0.49999976]
```

How to get the value corresponding to the target point on the function:
```python
import numpy as np
from sais import benchmark_result


x = np.random.uniform(np.pi, np.pi, 2)
y = sais.benchmark_result(x, 2)
print(x, y)
```
